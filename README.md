===============
[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/json-rpc-client.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-rpc-client) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grayjay/json-rpc-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grayjay/json-rpc-client)


Functions for creating a JSON-RPC 2.0 client.  See
http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification. This library supports
batch requests and notifications, as well as single method
calls.  It also provides a function for creating corresponding
server-side methods with the package
[json-rpc-server](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-rpc-server).
This library does not handle transport, so a function for
communicating with the server must be provided.

CHANGES I MADE

1. **Compatibility with Aeson 2:** Modifications to ensure compatibility with version 2 of the Aeson library, involving changes from `HashMap` to `Aeson.KeyMap` and `Aeson.Key` for JSON object manipulation.

2. **Text to Key Fix:** Adjustments for issues related to transitioning from text strings to Aeson's Key type in JSON object keys, as part of Aeson 2 compatibility efforts.

3. **GHC 9 Warnings Ignored:** Explicit ignoring of warnings produced by GHC version 9, likely to allow compilation without addressing these warnings directly.

4. **Fixed Typo in GHC Option:** Correction of a typo in a GHC compilation option, pertaining to compiler flags used in the project configuration or build processes.

5. **Temporarily Removing Tests to Build:** Temporary removal of tests to facilitate building the project, indicating a workaround for test failures or dependency issues during development.

6. **Test File Edits:** Modifications to test files, possibly including compatibility adjustments for library updates, changes in testing strategies, or improvements to test coverage and effectiveness.

7. **Code Refactoring and Bug Fixes:**
   - Refactoring to use `replicateM` instead of `sequenceA . replicate` for creating a batch of RPC calls, improving readability or efficiency.
   - Updates for Aeson's KeyMap and Key types use in JSON object construction and manipulation, reflecting Aeson 2 compatibility.
   - Miscellaneous fixes and improvements, including adjustments to GHC options and handling of JSON RPC identifiers.

These changes reflect a focused effort on updating the library for newer versions of dependencies (like Aeson 2), addressing compiler warnings, and improving the codebase through various fixes and refactoring.
